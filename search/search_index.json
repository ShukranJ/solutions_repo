Dependence on Initial Velocity: The range scales with the square of the initial speed ( \ud835\udc45 \u221d \ud835\udc63 0 2 R\u221dv 0 2 \u200b ). Thus, doubling \ud835\udc63 0 v 0 \u200b quadruples the range. Gravity\u2019s Effect: Larger gravitational acceleration reduces the range ( \ud835\udc45 \u221d 1 \ud835\udc54 R\u221d g 1 \u200b ). Analysis of the Range Effect of the Angle of Projection The formula \ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc63 0 2 sin \u2061 ( 2 \ud835\udf03 ) \ud835\udc54 R= g v 0 2 \u200b sin(2\u03b8) \u200b shows that \ud835\udc45 R is maximized when sin \u2061 ( 2 \ud835\udf03 ) sin(2\u03b8) is at its maximum value, which occurs at \ud835\udf03 = 45 \u2218 \u03b8=45 \u2218 . In addition, complementary angles (e.g., 30 \u2218 30 \u2218 and 60 \u2218 60 \u2218 ) yield the same range. Effects of Initial Velocity and Gravity Initial Velocity: Since \ud835\udc45 \u221d \ud835\udc63 0 2 R\u221dv 0 2 \u200b , a small increase in speed leads to a substantial increase in range. High-speed projectiles travel much further. Gravity: A stronger gravitational field (larger \ud835\udc54 g) results in a shorter range. For example, on the Moon (with \ud835\udc54 \u2248 1.6 \u2009 m/s 2 g\u22481.6m/s 2 ), the range would be significantly greater than on Earth. Practical Applications Sports Soccer & Baseball: Players often aim for launch angles close to 45 \u2218 45 \u2218 to maximize distance. Basketball: Shots might use higher arcs for better chances of scoring. Engineering & Ballistics Artillery: Designing trajectories for maximum range usually involves angles near 45 \u2218 45 \u2218 . Aerospace: Projectile motion under varying gravitational fields is critical in planning spacecraft trajectories. Uneven Terrain When the landing height differs from the launch height, the vertical motion is modeled as: \ud835\udc66 ( \ud835\udc61 ) = \ud835\udc66 0 + \ud835\udc63 0 sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \u2009 \ud835\udc61 \u2212 1 2 \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc61 2 y(t)=y 0 \u200b +v 0 \u200b sin(\u03b8)t\u2212 2 1 \u200b gt 2 Setting \ud835\udc66 ( \ud835\udc61 ) = \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc53 y(t)=y f \u200b and solving for \ud835\udc61 t using the quadratic formula allows adjustment of the range calculation: 1 2 \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc61 2 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 0 sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \ud835\udc61 + ( \ud835\udc66 0 \u2212 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc53 ) = 0 2 1 \u200b gt 2 \u2212v 0 \u200b sin(\u03b8)t+(y 0 \u200b \u2212y f \u200b )=0 The horizontal range becomes: \ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc63 0 cos \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \u22c5 \ud835\udc61 landing R=v 0 \u200b cos(\u03b8)\u22c5t landing \u200b Air Resistance and Wind Effects Air Resistance: The drag force on a projectile is given by: \ud835\udc39 drag = 1 2 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc63 2 F drag \u200b = 2 1 \u200b C d \u200b \u03c1Av 2 This force reduces the range and alters the trajectory shape, necessitating numerical simulations for accurate predictions.
