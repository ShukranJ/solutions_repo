The goal of this problem is to analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Despite the apparent simplicity of launching an object into the air, the underlying physics involves a delicate interplay between vertical and horizontal motion, governed by both linear and quadratic relationships. These relationships are influenced by parameters such as: Initial velocity : \\( v_0 \\) Gravitational acceleration : \\( g \\) Launch height : \\( h \\) v 0 \u200b Gravitational acceleration \ud835\udc54 g Launch height \u210e h These variables result in a wide variety of possible trajectories, modeling real-world phenomena such as the arc of a soccer ball or the path of a rocket. Theoretical Background Assume an object is launched from flat ground with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) above the horizontal. Neglecting air resistance: \u03b8 (above the horizontal).

The function \ud835\udc45 ( \ud835\udf03 ) R(\u03b8) is symmetric about 45\u00b0, i.e., \ud835\udc45 ( \ud835\udf03 ) = \ud835\udc45 ( 90 \u2218 \u2212 \ud835\udf03 ) R(\u03b8)=R(90 \u2218 \u2212\u03b8). Higher initial velocities result in longer ranges. This model assumes no air resistance and launch/landing at equal heights. Limitations and Extensions Limitations: No air drag or wind. Assumes flat terrain. Possible Extensions: Add launch height \u210e h: modifies the time of flight. Include air resistance for a more realistic model. Simulate launch and landing at different heights or sloped surfaces. Deliverables A Markdown or Jupyter Notebook including: Theoretical derivations and equations.
