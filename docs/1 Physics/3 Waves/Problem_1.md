# Problem 1: Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

## Motivation

Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this phenomenon can be observed as ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns visually demonstrate how waves combineâ€”either reinforcing each other (constructive interference) or canceling out (destructive interference).

Studying these patterns deepens understanding of wave behavior and phase relationships in a simple, intuitive way. This hands-on approach is useful for exploring wave physics and real-world applications such as acoustics, optics, and fluid dynamics.

## Problem Statement

A circular wave on a water surface, emanating from a point source located at $\mathbf{r}_i$,  
can be described by the **Single Disturbance equation**:

$$
\eta(\mathbf{r}, t) = A \cos(k r - \omega t + \phi)
$$

where:  
- $\eta(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the displacement of the water surface at position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$,  
- $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,  
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, with $\lambda$ the wavelength,  
- $\omega = 2 \pi f$ is the angular frequency, with $f$ the frequency,  
- $r = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i|$ is the distance from the source at $\mathbf{r}_i$ to the point $\mathbf{r}$,  
- $\phi$ is the initial phase.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Select a Regular Polygon**  
   Choose a regular polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, regular pentagon).

2. **Position the Sources**  
   Place point wave sources at the vertices of the selected polygon, each at position $\mathbf{r}_i$.

3. **Wave Equations**  
   Write the wave equation emitted from each source $i$:

   $$
   \eta_i(\mathbf{r}, t) = A \cos(k |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i| - \omega t + \phi_i)
   $$

   Assuming all sources have the same amplitude $A$, wavelength $\lambda$, frequency $f$,  
   and phase $\phi_i = 0$ for coherence.

4. **Superposition of Waves**  
   Apply the principle of superposition by summing the displacements from all $N$ sources:

   $$
   \eta_{\mathrm{total}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \eta_i(\mathbf{r}, t) = \sum_{i=1}^N A \cos(k |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i| - \omega t)
   $$

5. **Analyze Interference Patterns**  
   Analyze $\eta_{\mathrm{total}}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ as a function of position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$  
   to identify regions of:

   - **Constructive interference:** where waves reinforce ($\eta$ maxima),  
   - **Destructive interference:** where waves cancel out ($\eta$ minima).

6. **Visualization**  
   Create graphical representations of the interference patterns on the water surface for the chosen polygon.

## 3. Python Simulation Implementation

Below is a Python script that simulates the interference pattern on the water surface due to wave sources placed at the vertices of a regular polygon. It calculates the total displacement of the water surface over a 2D grid at a fixed time, illustrating the constructive and destructive interference regions.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def polygon_vertices(radius, n_sides):
    """
    Compute vertices of a regular polygon centered at origin.
    
    radius: distance from center to each vertex (meters)
    n_sides: number of vertices (polygon sides)
    """
    angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, n_sides, endpoint=False)
    x = radius * np.cos(angles)
    y = radius * np.sin(angles)
    return np.vstack((x, y)).T  # shape (n_sides, 2)

def wave_displacement(points, sources, k, omega, t, A=1.0):
    """
    Calculate total displacement at grid points due to all sources at time t.
    
    points: array of shape (num_points, 2) with (x, y) positions
    sources: array of shape (num_sources, 2) with (x, y) source positions
    k: wave number (2pi / wavelength)
    omega: angular frequency (2pi * frequency)
    t: time (seconds)
    A: amplitude
    """
    displacement = np.zeros(points.shape[0])
    for source in sources:
        r = np.linalg.norm(points - source, axis=1)
        r[r == 0] = 1e-10  # prevent division by zero
        displacement += A * np.cos(k * r - omega * t)
    return displacement

# Simulation parameters
n_sides = 5              # number of polygon sides, e.g. pentagon
radius = 1.0             # distance from center to vertices (meters)
wavelength = 0.5         # meters
frequency = 1.0          # Hz
k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength
omega = 2 * np.pi * frequency
amplitude = 1.0
time = 0.0               # time instant for snapshot

# Generate polygon vertices (sources)
sources = polygon_vertices(radius, n_sides)

# Create grid points for simulation
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 400)
y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 400)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
points = np.vstack([X.ravel(), Y.ravel()]).T

# Calculate total wave displacement at each grid point
displacement = wave_displacement(points, sources, k, omega, time, amplitude)
Z = displacement.reshape(X.shape)

# Plotting the interference pattern
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=100, cmap='RdBu')
plt.colorbar(label='Displacement')
plt.scatter(sources[:, 0], sources[:, 1], color='black', label='Sources')
plt.title(f'Interference Pattern - {n_sides}-sided Polygon Sources')
plt.xlabel('x (m)')
plt.ylabel('y (m)')
plt.legend()
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()
```

## Considerations

- All sources emit waves with identical amplitude $A$, wavelength $\lambda$, and frequency $f$.


- The waves are coherent, maintaining constant phase relationships.  
- Numerical simulation tools such as Python (with NumPy and Matplotlib) are used for modeling and visualization.

## Deliverables

- A Markdown document including the Python script or notebook implementing the simulation.  
- A detailed explanation of the interference patterns observed, related to the polygon shape and wave parameters.  
- Graphical representations showing regions of constructive and destructive interference on the water surface.
