# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Deriving the Equations of Motion

Consider a projectile launched from the origin at an initial speed \( v_0 \) and angle \( \theta \) above the horizontal. The acceleration due to gravity is \( g \) downward.

- **Horizontal motion:**

\[
x(t) = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t
\]

- **Vertical motion:**

\[
y(t) = v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

These come from integrating the acceleration \( \vec{a} = (0, -g) \) twice, with initial velocity components \( v_0 \cos\theta \) and \( v_0 \sin\theta \).

### 1.2 Family of Solutions

The time of flight \( T \) is found by setting \( y(T) = 0 \) (returns to launch height):

\[
v_0 \sin\theta \cdot T - \frac{1}{2} g T^2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}
\]

The horizontal range \( R \) is:

\[
R = x(T) = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot T = \frac{v_0^2}{g} \sin 2\theta
\]

The family of solutions depends on \( v_0 \), \( g \), and \( \theta \). Changing these parameters alters the shape and extent of the projectile’s trajectory.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

The range \( R \) is maximal when:

\[
\sin 2\theta = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2\theta = 90^\circ \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = 45^\circ
\]

**Influence of parameters:**

- Increasing \( v_0 \) increases \( R \) quadratically.
- Increasing \( g \) decreases \( R \) inversely.
- The angle \( \theta \) controls the shape of the sine function, shifting the range.

## 3. Practical Applications and Limitations

### Real-world adjustments:

- Launch height different from zero modifies the time of flight and range.
- Air resistance reduces range and alters trajectory shape.
- Uneven terrain complicates impact points.

### Extensions:

- Include drag force proportional to velocity.
- Model wind as horizontal acceleration.
- Use numerical integration for non-constant acceleration.

## 4. Implementation: Python Simulation
### Python Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
v0 = 10  # initial velocity in m/s
g = 9.8  # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2

# Angle range from 0 to 90 degrees
angles_deg = np.linspace(0, 90, 1000)
angles_rad = np.deg2rad(angles_deg)

# Range formula
range_values = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * angles_rad)) / g

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(angles_deg, range_values, label='Range vs Angle', color='teal')
plt.axvline(45, color='gray', linestyle='--', label='Maximum Range at 45°')

plt.title('Projectile Range as a Function of Launch Angle')
plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (meters)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

4. Graph and Interpretation
Visualization Overview
The plot generated by the simulation shows how the projectile range varies with respect to the launch angle from 0° to 90°.

Key observations:

The range increases as the angle increases from 0° to 45°.

The maximum range is achieved at 45°.

Beyond 45°, the range decreases symmetrically, approaching zero at 90°.

The plot is symmetric around 45°, confirming that:

Different launch angles can result in the same horizontal distance but with different flight characteristics (trajectory height and flight time).

Real-World Insight
Such graphical analysis provides a deeper understanding of projectile motion:

In sports, optimizing throw or kick angles improves performance.

In engineering, ideal launch angles reduce energy costs or material usage.

In aerospace, it helps model ideal launch trajectories (neglecting drag).

This visualization confirms the theoretical predictions and provides a strong foundation for exploring more complex or real-world scenarios in future sections.

5. Limitations and Further Improvements
Idealized Assumptions
This model makes several simplifying assumptions:

No air resistance: In reality, drag significantly affects the range, especially at higher velocities.

Launch from ground level: The model does not account for launches from elevated platforms or terrains.

Constant gravity: Gravitational acceleration is treated as constant, though it can vary slightly with altitude or location.

No wind or atmospheric effects: Wind direction and speed can greatly alter projectile behavior.

Possible Extensions
To increase realism, future versions of the model can include:

Air resistance (quadratic drag or using differential equations),

Launch from an arbitrary height,

Custom terrain elevation or slope,

Variable gravitational environments (e.g., other planets),

3D projectile motion.
